# SkillsUSA2017
My winning project for skillsusa utah 2017

This app loads a contact file and you can add, remove, and view contacts within the app. Uses Object serialization.

uncomment the main method in Contacts Main and run that in the terminal for a command line version.

Otherwise MainWindow.java has the main method for the GUI.

Default directory for saving files is the current working directory. Within the GUI, this can be changed.
